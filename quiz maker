# Step 1: Mini Knowledge Base (like RAG data)
data = [

    "The Sun is a star in the solar system.",
    "Water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius.",

# Step 2: Ask a quiz question
print("Welcome to the Quiz Game!")

# Step 3: Simulate retrieving a fact
import random
fact = random.choice(data)

# Step 4: Create a question from fact

# Step 5: Ask and check answer
print("Question:", question)

# Step 6: Analyze the answer
