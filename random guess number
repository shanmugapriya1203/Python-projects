1 — Explain the game flow aloud (1–2 minutes)
Walk students through the expected interaction:
Program picks a secret digit (0–9).
Player types a single digit and presses (or it registers immediately).
Program compares the typed digit with the secret.
Program displays feedback: “Too low”, “Too high”, or “Correct”.
If correct: show attempts used and offer restart.

2 — Pseudocode on the board (3–5 minutes)
Write simple steps (no code) so students see the logic:
Start program → choose secret digit randomly.
Show input box and message: “Guess a number 0–9”.
When user presses a key:
If Backspace → clear
If digit → set guess = digit
Compare guess to secret
If guess < secret: show “Too low”
If guess > secret: show “Too high”

If guess == secret: show “Correct — you used X tries”

Increase attempt count each time a non-empty guess is checked.

Option to restart (set a new secret and reset attempts).

3 — Build small parts in sequence (hands-on)

Break coding into tiny deliverables. Test each before moving on.

Part A — Secret number generation (teacher demo)

Explain random.randint(0,9) conceptually (pick one number).

Show where to store secret (variable secret).

Part B — Show input box & read a single digit (student task)

Reuse the single-digit input box code they already learned.

When user types 0–9, store it as guess (replace old value).

Part C — Compare and give feedback (student task)

After receiving guess:

If guess is less than secret → display “Too low”

If greater → “Too high”

If equal → “Correct!”

Make sure the feedback appears on screen clearly.

Part D — Count attempts

Add a variable attempts = 0.

When a guess is made (and is not empty), do attempts += 1.

            if event.key == pygame.K_BACKSPACE:
                text = text[:-1]  # delete last char
            else:
                text += event.unicode  # add typed char

    pygame.display.update()

pygame.quit()


When correct, display the attempts count with the success message.
