# Step 1: Learning content (like a mini knowledge base)
documents = [
    "The Sun is the closest star to Earth.",
    "It provides light and heat.",
    "The Sun is very large and made of hot gases.",
    "Plants use sunlight to make food through photosynthesis.",
    "The Moon reflects sunlight and appears bright at night.",
    "Mars is called the Red Planet because of its color."
]

# Step 2: Retrieval - Search sentences related to a topic
def retrieve_info(topic, docs):
    return [doc for doc in docs if topic.lower() in doc.lower()]

# Step 3: Generation - Generate question from sentence
def generate_question(info):
    if "sun" in info.lower():
        return "What is the Sun?"
    elif "light and heat" in info.lower():
        return "What does the Sun provide?"
    elif "gases" in info.lower():
        return "What is the Sun made of?"
    elif "photosynthesis" in info.lower():
        return "How do plants use sunlight?"
    elif "moon" in info.lower():
        return "Why does the Moon shine?"
    elif "mars" in info.lower():
        return "Why is Mars called the Red Planet?"
    else:
        return "What did you learn from this sentence?"

# Step 4: Combine Retrieval and Generation
def quiz_maker(topic):
    print(f"\n📘 Topic: {topic}")
    info_list = retrieve_info(topic, documents)
    
    if not info_list:
        print("❌ No information found for this topic.")
        return
    
    for info in info_list:
        question = generate_question(info)
        print("\n📚 Info:", info)
        print("❓ Question:", question)

# Step 5: Run it
while True:
    user_topic = input("\n🔎 Enter a topic (like sun, moon, mars) or 'exit' to stop: ")
    if user_topic.lower() == "exit":
        print("👋 Goodbye!")
        break
    quiz_maker(user_topic)
